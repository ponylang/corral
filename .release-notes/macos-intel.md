## Add macOS on Intel as a fully supported platform

We've added macOS on Intel as a fully supported platform. This means that we test corral on macOS on Intel and provide nightly and release binaries of corral.

We plan to maintain macOS on Intel support for as long as we have access to a CI environment that supports it or until Apple stops supporting new macOS versions on Intel CPUs.
