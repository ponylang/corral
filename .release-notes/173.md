## Switch support FreeBSD version

We've switched our supported FreeBSD from 12.1 to 12.2. The switch means that FreeBSD packages are tested and built on FreeBSD 12.2 and we no longer do any testing or building on 12.1.

You can continue using corral on FreeBSD 12.1 but we make no guarantees that it will work.
