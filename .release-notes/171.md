## Change "unknown branch" default to 'main'

GitHub has switched its default branch name from `master` to `main` for newly created repositories. Given this change, we expect that eventually most repositories will have their default branch named `main`, not `master`.

Corral will now use `main` and not `master` for the branch to use when using git or hg repos as a source.

Any corral.json dependency entries that aren't using a version should be updated to include `master` as the version to continue working as they did before or if you control the dependency, update its default branch to `main` and things will continue to work as before.
