## Add `documentation_url` entry to bundle manifest

documentation_url will allow a forthcoming feature in the pony compiler to generate documentation for code that uses a given bundle to link to the documentation for that bundle from the code in question.

For example, `ponylang/http` will have its documentation link directly to the documentation for `ponylang/regex` and `ponylang/net_ssl` for types that come from those bundles.
