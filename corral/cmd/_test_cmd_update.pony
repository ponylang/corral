  Issue #120 identified a problem with transitive dependencies that resulted

  The test as currently constituted, consists of a bundles with 2
  dependencies. One of those has 2 more in a transitive fashion, that should
  result in 4 syncs and corresponding actions happening. However, due to a
  bug in _Updater, it currently does 11.

  With a real VCS like Git, the number that results from it is variable
  based on timing. This test exists to prove that issue #120 is fixed and
  to prevent a similar bug from being introduced in the future.
