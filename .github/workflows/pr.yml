  # Currently, Github actions supplied by GH like checkout and cache do not work
  # in musl libc environments on arm64. We can work around this by running
  # those actions on the host and then "manually" doing our work that would
  # normally be done "in the musl container" by starting the container ourselves
  # for various steps by invoking docker directly.
  #
  # This is not in line with our standard pattern of "just do it all in the
  # container" but is required to work around the GitHub actions limitation
  # documented above.
