## Status

[![Actions Status](https://github.com/ponylang/corral/workflows/vs-ponyc-latest/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ponylang/corral/actions)

Corral is alpha level software. We advise you use [stable](https://github.com/ponylang/pony-stable) for your dependency management needs. We are looking for help building out Corral and would love if you help out with any of the [open issues](https://github.com/ponylang/corral/issues).

## About Corral

Corral is a dependency management tool for [Pony](https://www.ponylang.io). Our goal with Corral is to start from scratch and come up with a full featured replacement for [stable](https://github.com/ponylang/pony-stable), the current dependency management tool for Pony. Corral builds on the work done in stable and adds some new things:

* Uses Pony cli package for command line parsing.
* Provides extensibility for VCS and Commands.
* Supports semver version constraints on dependencies.
* Supports transitive dependencies.
* Supports revision locking on dependencies using a lock.json file.
* Uses the Pony process package for running external tools like Git and ponyc.
* Uses a distinct shared VCS repo pool from per-project dependency workspace tree.

### Design

See [Corral Design](doc/design.md) for more details about the design of Corral. Ongoing questions and notes for future work can be found in [Questions / Notes](doc/questions_notes.md)

### Background

Check out [Pony Package Dependency Management](doc/package_dependency_management.md) for a discussion of the research and requirements work behind Corral.

## Installation

Use [ponyup](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyup) to install corral.

The following command is assuming that `ponyup`, our toolchain multiplexer, is already installed on your machine and `~/.pony/ponyup/bin` is already added to your $PATH environment variable. If you don't have it installed, please follow the [instructions](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyup#installing-ponyup).

It will download the latest release of `corral` and install it to `~/.pony/ponyup/bin` by default. 

```bash
ponyup update corral release
```

## Building From Source

See [BUILD.md](BUILD.md)

## Getting started using Corral

After installation, add Corral's current path to $PATH environment variable if you haven't already and follow these steps to create your first project using Corral.

1. Create the project. Make an empty folder and switch to this directory. This will be our example project to use Corral

```bash
mkdir myproject
cd myproject
```

2. Initialize Corral. It will create `corral.json` and `lock.json` files. At this moment they won't have much information since you haven't added any dependencies yet.

```bash
corral init
```

3. Add a dependency. This is the way to tell Corral that your project depends on this and you want to include it when building your project.

```bash
corral add github.com/ponylang/valbytes.git
```

4. Use a dependency. Create a file `main.pony` with following code.

```pony
use "valbytes"

actor Main
  new create(env: Env) =>
    var buf: ByteArrays = ByteArrays
    buf = buf + "!!" + "Hello," + " " + "World!"
    let greetings = buf.drop(2).string()
    env.out.print(greetings)
```

5. Fetch dependencies. The example Pony code is using `ByteArrays` type which is defined in the dependency which you have just added. Pony needs to have the source code of `ByteArrays` type to compile successfully. By fetching, Corral retrieves the source and makes it available when compiling the source code 

```bash
corral fetch
```

6. Build the project. Corral will now use this information to build the project. The command below act as a wrapper for `ponyc`

```bash
corral run -- ponyc
```

If there are no errors generated then an executable `myproject` will be created in the same folder.

You will also notice that there are two new folders `_corral` and `_repos` in your project folder now. They were generated by the `corral fetch` command. Please make sure to include them in your `.gitignore` file as there is no need to keep them in a versioning system since they are maintained by Corral itself.
