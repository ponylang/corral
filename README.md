# Corral

[Pony](https://ponylang.io) dependency manager

## Status

Corral is beta level software.

## About Corral

Corral is a dependency management tool for [Pony](https://www.ponylang.io). Corral:

* Provides extensibility for VCS and Commands.
* Supports semver version constraints on dependencies.
* Supports transitive dependencies.
* Supports revision locking on dependencies using a lock.json file.
* Uses a distinct shared VCS repo pool from per-project dependency workspace tree.
* Uses the Pony process package for running external tools like Git and ponyc.

### Design

See [Corral Design](doc/design.md) for more details about the design of Corral. Ongoing questions and notes for future work can be found in [Questions / Notes](doc/questions_notes.md)

### Background

Check out [Pony Package Dependency Management](doc/package_dependency_management.md) for a discussion of the research and requirements work behind Corral.

## Installation

Use [ponyup](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyup) to install corral.

The following command is assuming that `ponyup`, our toolchain multiplexer, is already installed on your machine and is available in your $PATH environment variable. If you don't have ponyup installed, please follow the [ponyup installation instructions](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyup#installing-ponyup).

```bash
ponyup update corral release
```

## Building From Source

See [BUILD.md](BUILD.md)

## Getting started using Corral

After installation, add Corral's current path to $PATH environment variable if you haven't already and follow these steps to create your first project using Corral.

### Create a project

Make an empty folder and switch to this directory. This will be our example project to use Corral

```bash
mkdir myproject
cd myproject
```

### Initialize Corral

It will create `corral.json` and `lock.json` files. At this moment they won't have much information since you haven't added any dependencies yet.

```bash
corral init
```

### Add a dependency

This is the way to tell Corral that your project depends on this and you want to include it when building your project.

```bash
corral add github.com/ponylang/valbytes.git
```

### Use a dependency

Create a file `main.pony` with following code.

```pony
use "valbytes"

actor Main
  new create(env: Env) =>
    var buf: ByteArrays = ByteArrays
    buf = buf + "!!" + "Hello," + " " + "World!"
    let greetings = buf.drop(2).string()
    env.out.print(greetings)
```

### Fetch dependencies

The example Pony code is using `ByteArrays` type which is defined in the dependency which you have just added. Pony needs to have the source code of `ByteArrays` type to compile successfully. By fetching, Corral retrieves the source and makes it available when compiling the source code

```bash
corral fetch
```

### Build the project

Corral will now use this information to build the project. The command below act as a wrapper for `ponyc`

```bash
corral run -- ponyc
```

If there are no errors generated then an executable `myproject` will be created in the same folder.

You will also notice that there are two new folders `_corral` and `_repos` in your project folder now. They were generated by the `corral fetch` command. Please make sure to include them in your `.gitignore` file as there is no need to keep them in a versioning system since they are maintained by Corral itself.
