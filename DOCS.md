## Create a project with dependencies

### GitHub or GitLab or Bitbucket

Use a bundle from the internet.

```bash
mkdir myproject && cd myproject

corral add github.com/jemc/pony-inspect.git

echo '
use "inspect"
actor Main
  new create(env: Env) =>
    env.out.print(Inspect("Hello, World!"))
' > main.pony
```

This form works the same way for gitlab.com and bitbucket.com.

You can also include additional bundle paths after the repo, such as:
`github.com/ponylang/corral-test-repo.git/bundle1`

In addition, you can specify version constraints using this form:
`--version='>=1.1.0 <2.0.0`
or specific tags or commits like `--version='1.2.3'` or `--version=c061655c`.

### Local git Bundle

Use a bundle from a local repo that might have private changes or is not yet pushed.

```bash
mkdir myproject && cd myproject

corral add ../pony-inspect.git

echo '
use "inspect"
actor Main
  new create(env: Env) =>
    env.out.print(Inspect("Hello, World!"))
' > main.pony
```

The bundle path and version specification work the same as remote git.

### Local Direct Bundle

Use a bundle from local code that you are working on live.

```bash
mkdir myproject && cd myproject

corral add ../pony-inspect

echo '
use "inspect"
actor Main
  new create(env: Env) =>
    env.out.print(Inspect("Hello, World!"))
' > main.pony
```

The bundle path works the same as remote git, but versions are not applicable as the local bundle directory is referenced directly.

## Update Dependency Revisions

This step will fetch all dependencies, including transitive dependencies, and then it will calculate the best revisions for each and write them to the `lock.json` file. This file can also be edited by hand, or the update command run periodically to refresh dependencies to the latest constrained versions.

It is recommended that `lock.json` be checked in along with `corral.json` so that subsequent builds of the shared project use the same revisions for reproducability.

```bash
corral update
```

```console
git cloning github.com/jemc/pony-inspect.git into _repos/github_com_jemc_pony_inspect_git
git checking out @master into _corral/github_com_jemc_pony_inspect
```

## Fetch dependencies

This step will fetch dependencies using the current revisions in the `lock.json` file, or latest constrained version if there is no locked revision. This operation can be done after a new clone, or pull other changes to the `lock.json` file to ensure that the checked out dependencies are present and up to date.

Remote repos will be cloned into the *repo_cache* `_repos/` and checked-out revisions will be placed in the *corral_dir* `_corral`.

```bash
corral fetch
```

```console
git cloning github.com/jemc/pony-inspect.git into _repos/github_com_jemc_pony_inspect_git
git checking out @master into _corral/github_com_jemc_pony_inspect
```

## Compile With a Corral

The local paths to the dependency's bundle directories will be included in the `PONYPATH` environment variable, and available for use in the `ponyc` invocation.
You can run any custom command here - not just `ponyc`.

```bash
corral run -- ponyc --debug
```

```console
run: ponyc --debug
  exit: 0
